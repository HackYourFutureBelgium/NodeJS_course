## Reading list
In this course we will create an Express [Rest API](https://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/RESTful-API) for the backend of our own [9gag](https://9gag.com/) clone. We will make use of [HTTP methods](https://spring.io/understanding/REST).

We will also use some basic SQL: [SQL select](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_select.asp), [SQL select where clause](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp), [SQL update](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_update.asp)

//Please read all the links and try some SQL exercises from the w3school links
